# FY19 Modern Indirect Provider Assessment Bill of Materials

In this repo, you will find all the materials required to understand and perform a Modern Indirect Provider (MIPA), formerly 'good, better, best', baseline of your indirect provider business.

## Roadmap

This repo will be updated to include the GTM version of the GBB assessment and guidance. Work is underway to complete this and is expected to be completed in Q1 2019. There will be a major revision twice a year, with this repo being the authoritative partner-facing source of content.
